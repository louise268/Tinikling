        <h1>Tinikling</h1>
    </header>

    <p> <b>Tinikling</b> is a traditional Filipino folk dance that mimics the movement of birds called "<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buff-banded_rail>tikling</a>"as they walk between grass stems, run over tree branches, or dodge bamboo traps set by farmers. The dance is performed by dancers who step between large bamboo poles, which are rhythmically clapped together on the ground by two or more people.</p>
    <p>The dance involves at least two people beating, tapping, and sliding bamboo poles on the ground and against each other in coordination with one or more dancers who step over and in between the poles in a dance. Female dancers usually wear a dress called a <b>Balintawak</b> (a colorful dress with arched sleeves) or a <b>Patadyong</b> (a checkered loose skirt that’s often worn with a thin-fibered blouse). Males wear an embroidered formal shirt called the <b>Barong Tagalog</b> (the country’s national outfit for Filipino men). The Barong is usually paired with red trousers. All dancers perform the Tinikling while barefoot. It is traditionally danced to <a href= https://www.bing.com/videos/riverview/relatedvideo?&q=rondalla+tinikling&&mid=DD7726119F48D11E8813DD7726119F48D11E8813&&FORM=VRDGAR>rondalla music</a>, a sort of serenade played by an ensemble of stringed instruments.

    <p>Tinikling originated in <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leyte>Leyte, Philippines</a> during <b>Spanish colonisation</b>. The dance imitates the movement of tikling birds as they slyly dodged bamboo traps set by rice farmers on the island of Leyte to protect their fields from the birds. The dance was born out of the need of local Filipinos to survive the punishment of standing between two bamboo poles, which were then clapped together. It is said that Tinikling arose from the <b>punishments</b> imposed by Spanish landlords on Filipino peasants or workers. The story suggests that those who failed to meet their work quotas in the rice fields were forced to stand between bamboo poles that were clapped together. To avoid getting their feet caught, the workers had to move swiftly and gracefully, which eventually evolved into a rhythmic dance that we know now.</p>
