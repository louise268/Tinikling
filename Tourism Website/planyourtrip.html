    <h3>Travelling to Japan - <br>Are you a friend of the <br>air or the sea?</h3>
    <h4>By Plane</h4>
    <p class="normal">Japan's main airport hubs are situated just outside the major cities of Tokyo and Osaka. Narita Airport sits an hour-long express train ride from Tokyo in the neighboring prefecture of Chiba. Servicing most global destinations, along with a whole host of domestic flights, the airport is rightfully known as the gateway to Japan. For a better view of the airport, click here - Narita Airport: Narita Airport homepage <br><br>

        Flying directly into the metropolis from worldwide destinations has become a reality thanks to the development of Haneda, Tokyo's city airport. Once a designated domestic hub, Haneda Airport 
         has branched out into international flights meaning that visitors can be in the bustling city of Tokyo within half an hour of leaving the terminal. Check here for the official website - Haneda Airport: Haneda Airport homepage <br><br>
        
        Thought once inconceivable, it is now possible to visit Japan without stepping foot in Tokyo at all. Kansai International Airport (KIX) serves the western area of Japan housing the tourist-magnet city of Kyoto and the urban powerhouse of Osaka, along with the deeply spiritual ground of surrounding prefectures Nara 
         and Wakayama. The airport is located around 50 minutes from the bullet train hub of Shin-Osaka and 75 minutes away from Kyoto Station.<br><br>

        A whole host of other airport options are available throughout Japan welcoming in domestic and international flights—from the great white island of Hokkaido in the north, industrial Nagoya in the middle and subtropical Okinawa way down south.<br><br>
        
        When planning your trip, research the airports that will offer you your most convenient path into Japan.</p>

    <h4>By Boat</h4>
    <p class="normal">It is also possible to reach Japan by sea. The southern area of South Korea is surprisingly close to the Japanese archipelago, and ferries travel between cities such as Busan in South Korea and cities such as Kyushu and Osaka. The price of a ticket really depends on the longevity of your sea-legs. High-speed ferries can transport you from Hakata to Busan 3 hours 40 minutes for around 16,000 yen; however a journey to Osaka on the more laid-back Kampu Ferry takes a full twelve hours, but more wallet-friendly at under 10,000 yen.<br><br>

        If you happen to be visiting Japan's larger neighbor of China, it is also possible to ferry over to the land of the rising sun in around three days. Ferries run once a week from Shanghai and connect with the ports of Osaka and Kobe in west Japan and Nagasaki and Fukuoka on the southern island.<br><br>
        
        Direct cruises to Japan are rare. However, once you are in Japan, there are a number of options for circumnavigating the Japanese islands—including stop-offs in Korea and China—on the waves. Here are some options : Princess Cruises: Cruise schedules ,Cruise Compete: Cruise plans, Celebrity Cruises: Cruise plans <br><br>
        
        All information is correct as of the time of writing. Independent research is always advised for the most up-to-date and relevant information.

        <h3>Accomodation - <br>Blend comfort, tradition, <br>minimalism, and serene <br>hospitality.</h3>
        <p class="normal">Japan offers a diverse range of accommodations, catering to various preferences and budgets. Visitors can choose between the familiar comfort of western-style hotels or immerse themselves in the unique experience of traditional Japanese inns, known as ryokan. Western-style hotels provide modern amenities and services, ideal for those seeking convenience and familiarity. In contrast, ryokan offer a more intimate and culturally rich experience, with tatami-mat rooms, futon bedding, and often, communal hot spring baths (onsen). Additionally, Japan has budget-friendly options like minshuku (family-run guesthouses), capsule hotels for short stays, and luxurious resorts for those seeking a high-end experience. Whether you prefer modern comfort or traditional hospitality, Japan's accommodations ensure a memorable stay for every traveler.</p>

        <ul class="normal">
            <li>The accommodation charge is subject to a consumption tax of 10% (as of 1st October 2019).</li>
            <li>Some cities also charge an additional accommodation tax, usually not a percentage but a fixed tiered rate.</li>
            <li>Properties with onsen (hot springs) often charge a 'bathing tax' as well. This varies by region but is usually about 150 yen, charged per person.</li>
            <li>The above taxes are usually included in the total listed room rate.</li>
            <li>First class hotels may also impose a 10 to 15% service charge as well</li>
            <li>Tipping is not customary except at top luxury ryokan, where a guest will tip a maid when they first serve tea in the room.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="normal">Visitors to Japan are required to do the following when they check in at lodging facilities in Japan for the purpose of preventing infectious diseases and terrorism:</p>
